     * Once created, the track needs to be started before it can be used.
     * Unspecified values are set to appropriate default values.
     *
     * Parameters:
     *
     * streamType:         Select the type of audio stream this track is attached to
     *                     (e.g. AUDIO_STREAM_MUSIC).
     * sampleRate:         Data source sampling rate in Hz.  Zero means to use the sink sample rate.
     *                     A non-zero value must be specified if AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_DIRECT is set.
     *                     0 will not work with current policy implementation for direct output
     *                     selection where an exact match is needed for sampling rate.
     * format:             Audio format. For mixed tracks, any PCM format supported by server is OK.
     *                     For direct and offloaded tracks, the possible format(s) depends on the
     *                     output sink.
     * channelMask:        Channel mask, such that audio_is_output_channel(channelMask) is true.
     * frameCount:         Minimum size of track PCM buffer in frames. This defines the
     *                     application's contribution to the
     *                     latency of the track. The actual size selected by the AudioTrack could be
     *                     larger if the requested size is not compatible with current audio HAL
     *                     configuration.  Zero means to use a default value.
     * flags:              See comments on audio_output_flags_t in <system/audio.h>.
     * cbf:                Callback function. If not null, this function is called periodically
     *                     to provide new data in TRANSFER_CALLBACK mode
     *                     and inform of marker, position updates, etc.
     * user:               Context for use by the callback receiver.
     * notificationFrames: The callback function is called each time notificationFrames PCM
     *                     frames have been consumed from track input buffer by server.
     *                     Zero means to use a default value, which is typically:
     *                      - fast tracks: HAL buffer size, even if track frameCount is larger
     *                      - normal tracks: 1/2 of track frameCount
     *                     A positive value means that many frames at initial source sample rate.
     *                     A negative value for this parameter specifies the negative of the
     *                     requested number of notifications (sub-buffers) in the entire buffer.
     *                     For fast tracks, the FastMixer will process one sub-buffer at a time.
     *                     The size of each sub-buffer is determined by the HAL.
     *                     To get "double buffering", for example, one should pass -2.
     *                     The minimum number of sub-buffers is 1 (expressed as -1),
     *                     and the maximum number of sub-buffers is 8 (expressed as -8).
     *                     Negative is only permitted for fast tracks, and if frameCount is zero.
     *                     TODO It is ugly to overload a parameter in this way depending on
     *                     whether it is positive, negative, or zero.  Consider splitting apart.
     * sessionId:          Specific session ID, or zero to use default.
     * transferType:       How data is transferred to AudioTrack.
     * offloadInfo:        If not NULL, provides offload parameters for
     *                     AudioSystem::getOutputForAttr().
     * uid:                User ID of the app which initially requested this AudioTrack
     *                     for power management tracking, or -1 for current user ID.
     * pid:                Process ID of the app which initially requested this AudioTrack
     *                     for power management tracking, or -1 for current process ID.
     * pAttributes:        If not NULL, supersedes streamType for use case selection.
     * doNotReconnect:     If set to true, AudioTrack won't automatically recreate the IAudioTrack
                           binder to AudioFlinger.
                           It will return an error instead.  The application will recreate
                           the track based on offloading or different channel configuration, etc.
     * maxRequiredSpeed:   For PCM tracks, this creates an appropriate buffer size that will allow
     *                     maxRequiredSpeed playback. Values less than 1.0f and greater than
     *                     AUDIO_TIMESTRETCH_SPEED_MAX will be clamped.  For non-PCM tracks
     *                     and direct or offloaded tracks, this parameter is ignored.
     * selectedDeviceId:   Selected device id of the app which initially requested the AudioTrack
     *                     to open with a specific device.
     * threadCanCallJava:  Not present in parameter list, and so is fixed at false.
